Hello everyone, I wanted to inform you guys that I have fixed the "button" issue, and now you can see the "continue" button. Therefore, I don't think I need to update the apps, as it is done through the internet. So you don't need to update my mod to Roblox. If there is any problem with the buttons, please let me know on discord (click My Discord). Note that: I PUT THE BUTTON WITH THE NAME OF THE EMULATOR I USE. YOU CAN CLICK IT AND INSTALL THIS EMULATOR. FROM THERE PUT ROBLOX ON IT SO YOU WILL HAVE WORKING CHAMS AND MORE MODS! I'M GOING TO RECORD A TUTORIAL TODAY ON YOUTUBE HOW TO DO IT.
